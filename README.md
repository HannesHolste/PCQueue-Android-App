CSE110 Project
===============================

# Overview
An Android application that was developed part-time over the course of 7 weeks with a team of 5,
as a series of iterations using the agile methodology and working live with customers.

The application can be used to report and view queue times at restaurants (though currently the database only contains information on Price Center, UC San Diego restaurants). It supports multiple concurrent users and offline use.
